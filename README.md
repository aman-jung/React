# Shopping List 
In this project i created simple shopping list using React.
## Getting Started
#### React
React is a javascript library which is used for building user interfaces.
[More about React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
React is an independent reusable component that outputs a React Element based on its properties and state
There are two types of React Component
* [Functional Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
* [Class Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
In my project i made use of [Functional Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
### Understanding the code
I have created 4 functional component in my project.They are:
* Heading
* List
* Item
* ShoppingApp
<br/>
All these Functional component consists of one properties called props(since functional component consists only props). Props is used to extract value from the other components.I have declared props as arguments in all the function so that i can just declare the name and can extract value from other components.
In my project i have break the entire page into 4 functional components and make ShoppingApp components as a parent component or main component(where all the values is available).
